  abstract = {The paper concerns one simple method of calibration of an assembled inertial measurement units (IMU) of different grades on a low grade single axis turntable. The main feature of the method is that it has the weakest possible requirements to the testbench. The method was presented at ICINS 2010, ICINS 2013, and is now being used in industry for 3-4 years. It appears to work well in practice. One of special points of this method is the situation, when the IMU is displaced from the axis of rotation. In some cases this fact can be neglected, but in some cases not. It was shown earlier that parameters of this displacement need not to be measured prior to the experiment, but can be estimated automatically during the data processing, similar to the rest of IMU parameters. So the device can be placed arbitrarily onto the stand, and no care of displacement should be taken while conducting the experiment. This work concentrates primarily on aspects of observability and estimation accuracy of IMU displacement (which influence the accuracy of the calibration itself), and shows more variety of experimental results than in previous publications.},

  abstract = {Recently, micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensors have found their way in various applications. These sensors are fairly low cost and easily available but their measurements are noisy and imprecise, which poses the necessity of calibration. In this paper, we present an approach to calibrate an inertial measurement unit (IMU) comprised of a low-cost tri-axial MEMS accelerometer and a gyroscope. As opposed to existing methods, our method is truly infield as it requires no external equipment and utilizes gravity signal as a stable reference. It only requires the sensor to be placed in approximate orientations, along with the application of simple rotations. This also offers easier and quicker calibration comparatively. We analyzed the method by performing experiments on two different IMUs: an in-house built IMU and a commercially calibrated IMU. We also calibrated the in-house built IMU using an aviation grade rate table for comparison. The results validate the calibration method as a useful low-cost IMU calibration scheme.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an in-use calibration procedure for gyroscopes. The case report is a simple inertial measurement unit (IMU), which is used in our current research on inertial motion-sensing for advanced footware. The IMU contains two biaxial accelerometers and one gyroscope; it is developed for being mounted on one subject's foot instep, with the aim to reconstruct the trajectory in the sagittal plane of the sensed anatomical point. Since the IMU sagittal displacements can be estimated by performing strapdown integration, they can also be compared with their true values. One movement, which corresponds to known (vertical) displacements, consists of foot placements from the ground level on to top of steps of known height (step climbing). Provided that the IMU accelerometers are calibrated separately by any standard calibration procedure, motion tracking during the stepping movement allows to estimate the gyroscope sensitivity. The experimental results we present in this paper demonstrate the proposed in-use calibration procedure.},

  abstract = {Abstract: An approach for calibrating a low-cost IMU is studied, requiring no mechanical platform for the accelerometer calibration and only a simple rotating table for the gyro calibration. The proposed calibration methods utilize the fact that ideally the norm of the measured output of the accelerometer and gyro cluster are equal to the magnitude of applied force and rotational velocity, respectively. This fact, together with model of the sensors is used to construct a cost function, which is minimized with respect to the unknown model parameters using Newton's method. The performance of the calibration algorithm is compared with the Cram\'er-Rao bound for the case when a mechanical platform is used to rotate the IMU into different precisely controlled orientations. Simulation results shows that the mean square error of the estimated sensor model parameters reaches the Cram\'er-Rao bound within 8 dB, and thus the proposed method may be acceptable for a wide range of low-cost applications.

  abstract = {Motion sensors as inertial measurement units (IMU) are widely used in robotics, for instance in the navigation and mapping tasks. Nowadays, many low cost micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) based IMU are available off the shelf, while smartphones and similar devices are almost always equipped with low-cost embedded IMU sensors. Nevertheless, low cost IMUs are affected by systematic error given by imprecise scaling factors and axes misalignments that decrease accuracy in the position and attitudes estimation. In this paper, we propose a robust and easy to implement method to calibrate an IMU without any external equipment. The procedure is based on a multi-position scheme, providing scale and misalignments factors for both the accelerometers and gyroscopes triads, while estimating the sensor biases. Our method only requires the sensor to be moved by hand and placed in a set of different, static positions (attitudes). We describe a robust and quick calibration protocol that exploits an effective parameterless static filter to reliably detect the static intervals in the sensor measurements, where we assume local stability of the gravity's magnitude and stable temperature. We first calibrate the accelerometers triad taking measurement samples in the static intervals. We then exploit these results to calibrate the gyroscopes, employing a robust numerical integration technique. The performances of the proposed calibration technique has been successfully evaluated via extensive simulations and real experiments with a commercial IMU provided with a calibration certificate as reference data.},

  abstract = {Calibration of inertial measurement units (IMU) is carried out to estimate the coefficients which transform the raw outputs of inertial sensors to meaningful quantities of interest. Based on the fact that the norms of the measured outputs of the accelerometer and gyroscope cluster are equal to the magnitudes of specific force and rotational velocity inputs, respectively, an improved multi-position calibration approach is proposed. Specifically, two open but important issues are addressed for the multi-position calibration: (1) calibration of inter-triad misalignment between the gyroscope and accelerometer triads and (2) the optimal calibration scheme design. A new approach to calibrate the inter-triad misalignment is devised using the rotational axis direction measurements separately derived from the gyroscope and accelerometer triads. By maximizing the sensitivity of the norm of the IMU measurement with respect to the calibration parameters, we propose an approximately optimal calibration scheme. Simulations and real tests show that the improved multi-position approach outperforms the traditional laboratory calibration method, meanwhile relaxing the requirement of precise orientation control.},
